# Thesis_LDvL

This is the repository for my thesis project for the MSc Applied Data Science. The thesis project aimed to determine which variables are consistenly associated with item non-response through multiverse modelling. The data analysed was generated by a survey about mental health, alcohol consumption, and drug use among Scottish adolescents. The thesis (made with LaTeX) is in the Thesis.pdf file. The Rmarkdown file that knits this pdf is in Markdown.rmd. Finally, the source code is in SourceCode.rmd.
