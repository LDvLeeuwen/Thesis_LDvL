# Thesis_LDvL

This is the repository for my thesis project for the MSc Applied Data Science. The thesis project aimed to determine which variables are consistenly associated with item non-response through multiverse modelling. The data analysed was generated by a survey about mental health, alcohol consumption, and drug use among Scottish adolescents. The thesis (compiled with LaTeX and RMarkdown) is in the Thesis.pdf file. The Rmarkdown file that knits this pdf is in Markdown.rmd. Finally, the source code is in SourceCode.rmd. The data used in the project was retrieved from the website of the UK Data Service. This data cannot be publicly distributed, but can be accessed by filling in a form (more information at https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/registration/registration-login-faqs/). The intentions have to be non-commercial, and the user has to be associated with an academic institute. This academic institute does not have to situated in the United Kingdom, though. 

Finally, a critical side note about how many clusters the project analysed. Initially, the project analysed 4 clusters as the dependent variables, as the distance cutoff score mentioned later in the cluster analysis was 0.6. After feedback of my supervisor, this was considered too harsh, and a lower cutoff score of 0.2 was implemented. This resulted in 12 clusters, of which 10 were analysed.
